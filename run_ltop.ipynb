    "- Subsequent scripts have just the ee.Initialize protocal because you should have already authenicated and this should only happen once. \n",
    "- Right now this is going to import the params from a separate .py file and treat those as imports. It may actually be easier/more straight forward if we're going to stick with a Jupyter Notebook to just put these directly into a cell here in the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
