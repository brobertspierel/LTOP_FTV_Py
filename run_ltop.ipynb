    "- You need to authenticate the run with a specific GEE account. In the import params statement its going to trigger the ee.Authenticate() protocal which will prompt you to a browser page to authenticate using your GEE account. \n",
    "- Subsequent scripts have just the ee.Initialize protocal because you should have already authenicated and this should only happen once. \n",
    "- Right now this is going to import the params from a separate .py file and treat those as imports. It may actually be easier/more straight forward if we're going to stick with a Jupyter Notebook to just put these directly into a cell here in the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "- If you import a module at the top and then change something in the exe script you will need to restart or otherwise delete variables because that change won't be reflected otherwise. "
